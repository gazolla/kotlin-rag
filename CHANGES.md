# Improvements to Kotlin RAG Library

This document outlines the changes made to improve the Kotlin RAG library, focusing on the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

## 1. Elimination of Duplications (DRY)

### 1.1 Code Structure
- Consolidated duplicate `SimpleDocument` implementations into a single class
- Merged the `ranking` and `reranking` namespaces into a unified `reranking` package
- Standardized mock/dummy class names using consistent `Mock` prefix

### 1.2 Configuration System
- Refactored monolithic `RAGConfig` into modular components:
  - `IndexingConfig` for document processing and indexing
  - `RetrievalConfig` for search and retrieval 
  - `GenerationConfig` for LLM prompt generation
- Added delegated properties for backward compatibility
- Improved builder DSL with domain-specific configuration blocks

## 2. Interface Simplification (KISS)

### 2.1 Standardized Documentation
- Added consistent KDoc documentation for all core interfaces
- Standardized parameter and return value descriptions
- Used English for all documentation to maintain consistency

### 2.2 Error Handling
- Enhanced `ErrorHandler` with retry, circuit breaking, and fallback mechanisms
- Extended the `RAGException` hierarchy for better error classification
- Added support for error specificity without code duplication

### 2.3 Improved API Design
- Enhanced `QueryOptions` with builder methods for fluid API design
- Added utility functions to `RAGResponse` for common operations
- Standardized naming conventions across the codebase

## 3. Example Simplification

- Created a new `SimplifiedExample` demonstrating the improved design
- Used the cleaner builder DSL and modular configuration
- Improved code organization and readability

## 4. Future Improvements

### 4.1 Remaining Issues
- Further cleanup of cyclic dependencies between components
- Complete standardization of logging and metrics
- Ensure compliance with Kotlin coding conventions

### 4.2 Next Steps
- Enhance test coverage for new components
- Document API changes in developer documentation
- Create migration guide for users of earlier versions
